:warning: This package is still WIP, see [v1 roadmap milestone](https://github.com/viddo/atom-textual-velocity/milestones) for details. I'm planning to add some technical docs at some later point that should ease any intentions on contributing. But until then I :pray: for patience, and encourage you to [read & file issues](https://github.com/viddo/atom-textual-velocity/issues), and I I'll try to address them whenever I can.

Apart from the above, I warmly recommend a [Readme Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html) for any major changes, in addition to the [official Atom contributing guide](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) :bow:
