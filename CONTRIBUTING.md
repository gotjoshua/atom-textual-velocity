Same as [Atom contributing guide](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), and pleaes consider [Readme Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html) for any major changes.

**NOTE!** This project is still WIP, and will most likely change a lot internally over the next week months, so don't expect what you see now to be final in any way.
